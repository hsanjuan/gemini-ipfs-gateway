# About Gemini

Gemini is an application layer protocol (like HTTP) which is inspired in Gopher (one of the early internet protocols) and which aims for maximum simplicity.

As a protocol, it has many pitfalls, but it is simple!

One of the shortcomings per their own FAQ is the "lack of support for caching, compression and resumption of interrupted downloads".

But, guess who is awesome at caching stuff, even when partially downloaded?
