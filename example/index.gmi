# Gemini-IPFS example site


This is an example Gemini site hosted on IPFS.


The path you are visiting is actually a path to an IPFS folder, and you are reading the index.gmi file, which is automatically served when present in the folder.

When a folder does not have an index.gmi file in it, a directory listing is presented:

=> folder/

All files with .gmi extension will be returned with a declared text/gemini content-type. Of course, the gateway supports other file formats and automatically sets the content-type accordingly. For example, here you can see the ipfs-lite logo:

=> folder/ipfs-lite.png

ipfs-lite is a simple, easy-to-embed go-ipfs node, which powers this gateway. You can check it out at:
