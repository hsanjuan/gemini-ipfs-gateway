# Gemini-IPFS Gateway

This gateway exposes IPFS content over the [Gemini-protocol](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/).

Otherwise said, it allows to browse Gemini-sites (text/gemini) that are hosted on the IPFS network using Gemini-clients.

Runs as an all-contained-binary, based on [ipfs-lite](https://github.com/hsanjuan/ipfs-lite).
